# 📚 dsacpp-journal: A C++ DSA Journey

This repository tracks my daily progress in learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**.  
The goal is to stay consistent, solve problems daily, and build strong problem-solving skills.

---

## 📌 Getting Started – Learning C++ Fundamentals

Before diving into DSA, I’m spending time building a solid foundation in C++.

### Topics I'm covering:
- Input/Output
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators and Expressions
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Binary Number System
- Pointers and References
- Object-Oriented Programming (Basics)

📂 All C++ basics and practice code are stored in the `Cpp-Fundamentals/` folder.

## 🗓️ Daily Progress Log

I follow a simple daily structure:  
- Learn/revise one topic.  
- Solve a few problems.  
- Document everything.

📄 Check `Progress.md` for a quick summary of my daily activity.
